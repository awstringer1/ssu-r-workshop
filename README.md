This repository contains the workshop I am giving on November 21 2019
for the Statistics Student Union at the University of Toronto. The purpose is
to introduce first year students to the use of `R` for scientific computing
and data analysis.

You must bring a computer with RStudio installed to the workshop. Specifically, before the workshop you should do the following:

1. Download the free version of RStudio from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. Choose the correct link for your platform (windows, mac, linux).

1. Install the `tidyverse` package. Open RStudio and type `install.packages("tidyverse")` in the interactive console and press `Enter`. This will take a few minutes to run.

If you have trouble with these steps, ask your friends and/or Google any errors you get. You will be completing exercises in class during this workshop and you must come prepared.
